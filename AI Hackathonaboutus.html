<center><br>About Us
  
<center><br>We are high school students who are passionate about creating a better world. We recognize that due to the lack of adequate and specialized resources in schools, the education system is failing to identify at risk students before serious consequences occur.  

So, we wanted to create a solution that would solve this problem. Using the help of neural networks and Machine Learning, we have created The Student Net. The Student Net is a web platform built off of machine learning algorithms that will analyze a multitude of factors to identify at-risk students. Our program will identify the students who are at risk for dropping out or will have difficulty graduating and direct the guidance system to move their resources to support this student before serious consequences occur.
